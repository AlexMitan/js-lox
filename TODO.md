TODO:
    break:
        The syntax is a break keyword followed by a semicolon. It should be a syntax error to have a break statement appear outside of any enclosing loop. At runtime, a break statement causes execution to jump to the end of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds from there. Note that the break may be nested inside other blocks and if statements that also need to be exited.
